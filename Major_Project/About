Abstract: Stroke is a significant global health issue, ranking among the leading causes of death and long-term disability. With millions of people affected annually, the ability to predict and mitigate stroke risk is of paramount importance. This project harnesses the power of machine learning to develop a predictive model and an accompanying web application that estimates an individual's likelihood of experiencing a stroke based on various health and demographic factors. By providing early warnings and actionable insights, this tool aims to contribute to better health outcomes and more efficient medical interventions.your responses
