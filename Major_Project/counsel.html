                        <p>When stroke patients do not receive adequate support for mental health, it can hinder recovery and reduce motivation to pursue rehabilitation.</p>
                        <p>By treating stroke patients holistically – by taking into account mental and social factors, rather than just the physical symptoms of stroke – a better outcome can be achieved.</p>
                        <p>You’re about to learn why psychological care is important for stroke patients and how you can approach it.</p>

                        <p>When stroke patients can receive psychological care during the early stages of recovery, it can help improve levels of confidence, motivation, and wellbeing.</p>
                        <p>The benefits of psychological care create a virtuous cycle for the stroke patient. Unlike a vicious cycle, where negative events reinforce themselves, a virtuous cycle occurs when positive events reinforce themselves.</p>
                        <p>More psychological care results in more positive mood and confidence. Positive mood and confidence motivate more action towards recovery, which results in more physical improvements.</p>

                        <p>To negate the effects of post-stroke depression and other psychological disorders, better psychological care is needed.</p>

                        <p>Between 35%-60% of stroke patients experience cognitive impairments as well.</p>
                        <p>More than a third of stroke survivors struggle with post-stroke depression, the most common psychiatric disorder after stroke.</p>
